Aimed at understanding factors influencing car fuel efficiency, I analyzed a dataset correlating fuel consumption with engine size and cylinder count. Data visualization tools like Seaborn unveiled these connections, while a linear regression model, a machine learning technique,  predicted fuel efficiency based on engine data. The model's accuracy was assessed, and Matplotlib further clarified fuel consumption distribution across engine sizes. This project provided valuable insights, paving the way for future exploration of additional factors and potentially more advanced machine learning models for enhanced prediction accuracy.
